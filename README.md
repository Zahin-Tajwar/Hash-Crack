Hash-Crack(I mean like Hashcat), It cracks hashed passwords.

**Its a command line program that can convert 6 type of hashed password into plain text😁. But you need give a passlist and you can get the password if the lists have the password😢.**

### Instructions

- Enter the name of the passlist & make sure it's in the the same folder as the program(I have also given a passlist).
 
### Requirements
